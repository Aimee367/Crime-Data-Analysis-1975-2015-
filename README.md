# Crime-Data-Analysis-1975-2015

### Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of crime statistics spanning 40 years (1975-2015) across different geographical regions. The primary objective is to uncover trends, disparities, and correlations within the data to better understand crime patterns and their evolution over time.

### Key Objectives
- Analyze historical crime data to identify secular trends.
- Investigate geographical disparities and hotspots of crime activity.
- Compute and analyze crime rates relative to population size.

### Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Addressed missing values, standardized data formats, and ensured consistency.
     
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)**:
   - Aggregated crime statistics across years to visualize long-term trends.
   - Segmented data geographically to identify regional differences.
        
3. **Visualization**:
   - Leveraged interactive plots to enhance understanding, such as:
      ***. Line charts for temporal trends.***
      ***. Bar plots for crime categories.***
     ***. Heatmaps for geographical crime density.***
     
### Key Metrics
- Focused on crime per population ratios and year-over-year changes.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
   (git clone https://github.com/username/crime-data-analysis.git)
2. Install the required dependencies:

### Technologies Used
1) Python
2) Jupyter Notebook
3) Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
   
### Results
- Significant reduction in certain types of crime post-2000.
- Higher crime density in urban regions compared to rural counterparts.
- Temporal spikes in crime during specific socio-political events.
